  <h1>Hi, I'm Chris ðŸ‘‹</h1>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>I am currently working as a front-end developer at <a href="https://www.queo.de/">queo</a> in Dresden, Germany.</p>
    <p>
      This blog aims to reflect the topics that I work on or the tools that I work with.<br />
      I am also very new to blogging. And as most of the developers I know, I am usually not known for finishing side projects that I start. Sorry in advance, if there hasn't been a recent post in quite some time on this page. I try my best.
    </p>
    <p>Besides web development I'm also interested in cooking, plants and all sorts of music. Which means that there might be posts that are more off-topic then the rest.</p>
    <p>No matter how you got here, thank you for reading my blog. And I hope it helped you a little and you learned something new.</p>
    <p>Chris</p>
