Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Chris.

I'm an official member of Team Rocket, be aware!

Most of my time, I work as a front-end developer. Depending on my projects, I like to work with vanilla JS, React, Sass and Pug. Over the last years I've learned a lot about accessibility and semantic HTML as well.

I spend a lot of time thinking about design systems or how to make them more efficient and easier to work with. And sometimes I give talks or write posts about the things I recently think about.

At the moment I live in Dresden, Germany.
