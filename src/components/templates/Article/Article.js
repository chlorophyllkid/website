            Most of my time, I work as a front-end developer. Depending on my
            projects, I like to work with vanilla JS, React, Sass and Pug. Over
            the last years I've learned a lot about accessibility and semantic
            HTML as well.

            I spend a lot of time thinking about design systems or how to make
            them more efficient and easier to work with. And sometimes I give
            talks or write posts about the things I recently think about.
